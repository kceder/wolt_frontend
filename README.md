# Delivery Fee Calculator

A delivery fee calculator built with TypeScript and React. This is my first project using TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To run the project, use the following command:

`npm start`


To run tests for the project, use the following command:

`npm run test`


## Overview of the app

The main component of the application is the `DeliveryCalcComponent`, which includes four functions to calculate the distance fee, additional items fee, rush hour fee, and the total fee. The component also calls the `DisplayFee` component to show the final delivery fee.

Other components in the application include the `Header` and `Footer` components.

Styling for the application is done using Tailwind. The aim is to keep the application light and efficient.
