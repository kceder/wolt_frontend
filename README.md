A delivery fee calculator built with TypeScript and React. Assignment for Wolt.
This was my first time using TypeScript and a great excuse to do so!

## How to run?

To run the project, use the following command:

`npm start`

To run tests for the project, use the following command:

`npm run test`

## Overview of the app

Components:
+DeliveryCalcComponent
+DisplayFee
+Header
+Footer

The main component of the application is the `DeliveryCalcComponent`, which includes four input fields:
+ cart value
+ devivery distance
+ item count
+ felivery time 
and a button to calculate the delivery fee. On button click `DisplayFee` component is rendered to show the final delivery fee.

Other components in the application include the `Header` and `Footer` components.

Styling for the application is done using Tailwind. The aim is to keep the application light and efficient.
